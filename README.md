//***FILE1062 contains a handy TSO command called DSNQ (ENQ1DSN)    *   FILE1062
//*           that was fixed by Mr. Updater, and was originally     *   FILE1062
//*           taken from the large collection of programs in CBT    *   FILE1062
//*           File 270.  This handy program called DSNQ, looks at   *   FILE1062
//*           a dataset, and tells you who has an ENQUEUE to it     *   FILE1062
//*           (and what kind of ENQ).  Good for a quick inquiry.    *   FILE1062
//*                                                                 *   FILE1062
//*           The other TSO command included here is called         *   FILE1062
//*           ENQ1LOAD.  The ENQ1LOAD command displays enqueues     *   FILE1062
//*           by qname/rname, so you can get a more general enque   *   FILE1062
//*           display.                                              *   FILE1062
//*                                                                 *   FILE1062
//*           The program ENQ2LOAD is a necessary subprogram and    *   FILE1062
//*           therefore it is included here.                        *   FILE1062
//*                                                                 *   FILE1062
//*           Help members:  DSNQ# and ENQ1LOA# are included.       *   FILE1062
//*                                                                 *   FILE1062
//*           A load library is included in this pds, if you don't  *   FILE1062
//*           want to do the assembly/linkedit yourself.            *   FILE1062
//*                                                                 *   FILE1062
//*           email:   sbgolob@cbttape.org                          *   FILE1062
//*                                                                 *   FILE1062
//*           An interesting note:  These programs were written     *   FILE1062
//*           53 years ago, and ENQ1DSN and ENQ1LOAD each only      *   FILE1062
//*           required a 4-line minor fix.  They run perfectly on   *   FILE1062
//*           z/OS 3.1 today.                                       *   FILE1062
//*                                                                 *   FILE1062
